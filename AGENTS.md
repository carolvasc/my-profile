# AGENTS.md — Execution Guide

## Sources of truth
1. spec.md
2. docs/cv.pdf

If there is any conflict, spec.md wins.

## Rules
- Implement only the next unfinished milestone from spec.md.
- When completed, ask me to test the feature and if its all okay then ask me if you can mark completed checklist items with [x] in spec.md.
- Do not add features outside the spec.
- Do not use lorem ipsum.
- Use CV content for all personal/professional copy.
- Prefer Server Components; use `use client` only when strictly necessary.

## After each milestone
Explain:
- Files created or changed
- Key architectural decisions
- Server vs client rendering
- How CV data was mapped into the UI
